📌 Note: Coolers are allowed for a monthly fee of ₹600.

🏠 Boys Hostels – First-Year Options
For first-year boys, you can choose from three hostels:

BH-1 – 4-seater rooms

BH-2 – 4-seater rooms

BH-5 – 2-seater rooms

All three are exclusively for 1st-year students.

⚠ Appliances: Kettle, iron, etc., are officially not allowed in boys’ hostels. There are occasional staff checks. Use them at your own risk — and hide them like a pro if you dare 😏.

🏢 BH-1 Overview
Often considered the top choice for first years due to better infrastructure and extra facilities.

Blocks & Layout:
Three blocks – A, B, C. Each has Ground + 1st + 2nd floor.
Mess is on B Block Ground Floor, next to the hostel office.

Each room has 3 large almirahs and 1 smaller steel almirah — arrive early if you want one of the big ones before your roommates.

🛠 Facilities

Volleyball court, badminton court

AC reading room (with PCs) next to hostel office

Non-AC reading room in C Block (Ground Floor)

Common room with TV for cricket matches & events

TT table, chess, carrom

Small park for evening/night walks

Open gym inside hostel premises

Bring your own sports equipment

🚻 Washrooms

A Block: 3 Indian + 1 Western toilet per floor

B & C Block: Only Indian toilets per floor

Western toilet near hostel office for B & C residents

Geysers installed in washrooms

Clean overall, except after birthday “celebrations” 🎉

🍽 Mess & Food

Mess attached to B Block

Food quality: Decent; most adjust fine (except a few picky ones 😏)

📌 Block & Floor Preferences

Block: A > C > B

Floor: 1st > 2nd ≥ Ground (Ground is cooler but may have insects/mice)

🧺 Washing & Water

Washing machines:

A & B Block: Ground + 2nd Floor

C Block: 2nd Floor only

Water coolers: 1st Floor of each block + near hostel office

Winter: Hot water dispenser near A Block cooler

🏢 BH-2 Overview
Well-liked — some call it the best among 1st-year boys’ hostels. Spacious halls and more open layout compared to BH-1.

Room Type: 4-seater (usually 3 tables + 3 chairs, no fitted cupboards).

🛠 Facilities

Volleyball court, badminton space, TT room

Common room with TV for cricket matches & events

Study room with 3–4 tables + cooler (crowded during exams)

Clothes drying: No balconies on ground floor — dry behind hostel or use ropes in rooms

🚻 Washrooms

Almost all Indian-style toilets; no western toilets in blocks

Ground floor cleaned daily; upper floors less consistently

🍽 Mess & Food

Often considered to have the best mess among 1st-year boys’ hostels (though BH-1 is comparable)

Mess staff are friendly but may drop some late-night “love words” 😂

🎉 Hostel Night

Underwhelming — don’t expect a huge celebration

📌 Floor Preferences

Ground or 1st floor best; 2nd has some broken infrastructure

🧺 Washing & Water

Similar to BH-1

Clotheslines possible in rooms

Cooler in study room for summer use

🏢 BH-5 Overview
The only 1st-year boys’ hostel with 2-seater rooms — appealing for privacy but rooms are tiny (less than half the size of BH-1/BH-2). Only 2 beds and 1 table — space is tight, so don’t expect much actual privacy.

🛠 Facilities

Table tennis room

Volleyball court

🚻 Washrooms

Only Indian toilets

🍽 Mess & Food

Average quality

📌 Recommendation

Lower preference than BH-1 and BH-2 unless privacy is your top priority — but be aware it’s really cramped

🏠 Girls Hostels – First-Year Options
For first-year girls, you can choose from two hostels:

GH-1 – 2-seater & 3-seater rooms

GH-2 – 2-seater & 3-seater rooms

📌 GH-2 is mainly for 1st-years but has a few PhD scholars. GH-1 has some PhD scholars on the Ground Floor.

⚠ Appliances: Officially not allowed, but last year the warden generally didn’t mind.

🏢 GH-1 & GH-2 Overview
Same infrastructure and facilities. GH-2 is slightly bigger with an extra floor and houses the common mess for both. The gate between GH-1 and GH-2 is usually open for easy access.

Block & Layout:

GH-2: Ground + 1st + 2nd Floor

GH-1: Ground + 1st Floor

Mess in GH-2 (Ground Floor)

📌 Room Recommendation

3-seater rooms are much more spacious than 2-seaters in both hostels

🛠 Facilities

Common Mess (in GH-2)

Reading rooms in both hostels (GH-2 has AC reading room)

Gym room: Basic indoor equipment

Open gym for outdoor workouts

Small basketball ground at GH-1 entry

Nescafé outlet within girls’ hostel premises

🚻 Washrooms

Ratio ~1:6 (Western to Indian)

Geysers in washrooms

Generally well-maintained

🍽 Mess & Food

Same mess for both (in GH-2)

Decent quality with occasional variations

📌 Floor & Hostel Preferences

GH-2: 1st floor best; 2nd gets hot in summer

GH-1: Quieter, fewer residents, no mess inside so less noise

🧺 Washing & Water

Washing machines on all floors (some floors have two)

Two water coolers per floor

Hot drinking water available in GH-2 via dispenser

🛎 Hostel Allotment Process (First Year)
Here’s how it usually works:

After CSAB Round 2 results (date varies), the institute posts a hostel allotment link on the official website for admissions — keep checking regularly.

In that portal, you select your preferred hostel and room.

First come, first serve — if you want BH-1 1st floor (most preferred), be quick. Last year the entire A Block 1st floor filled in 5–6 minutes for HS people.

The portal shows room occupancy — in 4-seater rooms, there’ll be 2 HS (home state) + 2 OS (other state) students.

You can book with friends — coordinate ahead and grab the same room before it’s gone.

💡 Pro Tip: Have your friends on call, know your target block/floor in advance, and act fast — the best spots go in minutes.
