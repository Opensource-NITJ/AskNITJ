BRANCH UPGRADE
Is Branch Change available?
Yes, branch change is possible (for the current session (2025-2026) we will update it if there is any change next year), but it strictly depends on seat vacancies. Overall CGPA of your first year i.e. initial two semesters is considered. ( This year's vacancy list Note: There was also a vacant General seat in ECE that wasn’t initially listed.)

How Tough is Branch Change?
It depends on the branch you're targeting — not the branch you're currently in. For example, someone from IT to CSE and someone from Textile to CSE both compete equally based on CGPA alone.

Here are some real examples from this year:

MNC → CSE: 9.8 CGPA

ECE → CSE: 9.6 CGPA

EE → IT: 9.3 CGPA

Mech → IT: 9.4 CGPA

IPE → EE: 9.04 CGPA
Reality Check : It’s very competitive. A 9+ CGPA usually puts you in the top 3–4% of the batch. If you're thinking, "I'll study a bit and change branches later," please reconsider.

Only go for a branch you’re okay building your career in, even if the change doesn't happen.

What if my category seat isn't vacant?
In that case, you'll be considered against the OPEN category seats.

However, most vacancies (if any) are in the Open category as you can observe from the vacant seat data, and even those can sometimes be zero.

Is there any reservation for Females or HS students?
No, there’s no special reservation during branch change for female candidates or home state students.

If someone changes their branch does their previous seat become vacant and available for other?
Yes, it does.

Let’s say someone migrates from MNC to CSE — their seat in MNC becomes vacant.

Now, if someone from, say, Textile wants to shift to MNC, and earlier there was no vacancy in MNC — they can now be considered for that newly vacant seat if they meet the merit criteria.

This cascading process continues during the branch change round, so even if a branch didn’t have a vacancy initially, it might open up due to upward movement.
